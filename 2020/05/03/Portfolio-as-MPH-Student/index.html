        <p>This is a summary of my experiences and achievements in public health field so far when I graduate.</p>
<a id="more"></a>
<h2 id="Professional-Mission-Statement"><a href="#Professional-Mission-Statement" class="headerlink" title="Professional Mission Statement"></a>Professional Mission Statement</h2><p>By being in health fields for 7 years as a student, I deeply know that health is related with every details in our life from national level policies to our daily food consuming. To keep promoting health globally, expertise from different fields should work together.</p>
<p>I am gladly joined the biostatistics master’s program in the City University of New York, School of Public Health and Health Policy and the preventive medicine bachelor’s program in the Fudan University. With these experiences, I acquired understanding of all aspects of health career. Especially in data analyzing, I learned different epidemiology studies designs to deal with different aims of studies and their analyzing strategy. I am able to finish data processing, model building, fitting based on different type and distribution of exposure variable, outcome variable and covariates (predicting models are also understood), and results and data visualization in R, SAS and SPSS. I am familiar with different types of regression (linear logistic, poison, negative binomial), survival analysis (including cox regression), longitudinal data analysis and skills like using propensity score, interaction and weighting.</p>
<p>I hope I can contribute myself to revealing unknown patterns of health and diseases and interpreting professional results to public.</p>
<p>As the informatics technology in health field is maturing, new challenges are also generated for statisticians. I wish I can learn more from different fields and use my knowledge to promote health.</p>

<h2 id="Core-Competencies"><a href="#Core-Competencies" class="headerlink" title="Core Competencies"></a>Core Competencies</h2><p><strong>1. Apply epidemiological methods to the breadth of settings and situations in public health practice</strong></p>
<p>From the biostatistics and epidemiology courses, I not only learned the concepts of study designs and models as statistics students do, I also learned what problems could happen in public health contexts (e.g. missing data, selecting samples) and how to properly handle them.</p>
<p><strong>2. Select quantitative and qualitative data collection methods appropriate for a given public health context</strong></p>
<p>As a student in biostatistics track, I believe the most research that I may meet or execute in my future career would be quantitative analyses. Most statistical analyses will tell researches whether different measurements are ‘significantly’ different with each other and what is the extent of the difference. Both parts of the results are needed for scientific judgements.</p>
<p>For data collection, I learned how to used RedCap system from my fieldwork and course EPID 622 data management.</p>
<p><strong>3. Analyze quantitative and qualitative data using biostatistics, informatics, computer-based programming and software, as appropriate</strong></p>
<p>I have been trained to use R, SAS and SPSS to do statistical analyses. I also learned how to use MySQL by myself. From course EPID 630, I learned client - server structure which is the common structure of health informatics constructions and managing skills of health informatics projects.</p>
<p><strong>4. Interpret results of data analysis for public health research, policy or practice</strong></p>
<p>Interpreting results is crucial in biostatistics and epidemiology. I learned some standard sentence template of interpreting of different measurements (OR, RR, RD, etc.) and different study designs (cohort, cases control, random controlled trials, etc.) in course BIOS 611 and EPID 611. In BIOS 620 and EPID 620, I deeper understood the concepts of the study designs and models. Based on my knowledge, I am able to illustrate the meaning of statistical measurements to audiences with different level.</p>
<p><strong>5. Compare the organization, structure and function of health care, public health and regulatory systems across national and international settings</strong></p>
<p>In course CHSS 610 and HPAM 610, I learned some health structure in the United States, especially in the insurance field. I am able to tell what are mean insurance setting in the United States for different population, relationship between insurance company and policies and how physicians get salaries from patients’ insurance premium.</p>
<p><strong>6. Discuss the means by which structural bias, social inequities and racism undermine health and create challenges to achieving health equity at organizational, community and societal levels</strong></p>
<p>Bias is a common problem of epidemiology and statistics researches. With my experience learn from courses and practices, I am able to tell what are some potential selection bias and confounding effect or ecological fallacy due to races and policies.</p>
<h2 id="Biostatistics-and-Epidemiology-Competencies"><a href="#Biostatistics-and-Epidemiology-Competencies" class="headerlink" title="Biostatistics and Epidemiology Competencies"></a>Biostatistics and Epidemiology Competencies</h2><p><strong>1. Identify key sources of data for epidemiologic purposes</strong></p>
<p>I get known several public dataset for public health researching in course EPID 622 and BIOS 623. I also learned what are some institutions that I could ask for data sharing for researches. (e.g. NYC DOHMH)</p>
<p>In my fieldwork, I also learned how to organize data collection from participants.</p>
<p>With the knowledge learned from EPID 630, I realized that the data source of epidemiologic studies is broader than broader. We can know what are some key variable or measurements based on literature review and previous experience. However, the causal network is continuous rather than linking few points.</p>
<p><strong>2. Use measures of disease frequency and association to appropriately describe the distribution and determinants of disease, and appropriately characterize statistical uncertainty around such estimates</strong></p>
<p>Incidence, Prevalence are usually used for describing disease distribution in population. Risk Ratio, Odds Ratio, Risk Difference are usually used for comparing distributions of disease in different populations. With my experience in CUNY SPH, I am able to choose proper measurement based on the health, context, variable type, study design and model type</p>
<p><strong>3. Critically read and evaluate the strengths and limitations of epidemiologic literature from a methodological perspective. Summarize correctly and critically evaluate statistical analyses in published literature</strong></p>
<p>In epidemiology courses during CUNY SPH, students are asked for criticizing papers. Problems in reviewed papers are usually about:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><p>Sample size (Power)</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Hypothesis (Confused about difference between interested exposure and other covariates / Confused about difference between predicting model and other causal explaining model)</p>
</li>
<li><p>Interpret of Results</p>
</li>
<li><p>Participants Including and Excluding Criteria</p>
</li>
<li><p>Selection Bias / Internal Validity (Whether data and represent source population) / External Validity (Proper Target Population)</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>4. Select epidemiologic study designs, data collection techniques, and analytic approaches suitable for different scientific inquiries</strong></p>
<p>Cross-sectional Study, Case control Study, Cohort Study are discussed in epidemiology courses. And special data processing skills or models for variable with different type (continuous, discrete, time-event) are discussed in BIOS courses.</p>
<p><strong>5. Identify key threats to validity (internal and external) within and across epidemiologic studies</strong></p>
<p>Internal validity means whether the information in the dataset can properly represent the information of source population.</p>
<p>External validity means whether the source population can properly represent the target population of the study.</p>
<p>The discussion about validity should start at the beginning of the study. “In what population we want to reveal a association / causal pathway?”</p>
<p>In EPID and BIOS courses, I also learned some strategies to reduce lost follow ups. For example, preparing better gifts. (But also need control the value of the gift to reduce selection bias.) or schedule lower frequencies of meetings.</p>
<p>In course EPID 611, we also discussed about validity measurements like kappa and Cronbach’s alpha.</p>
<p><strong>6. Use statistical software to collect, retrieve, analyze and summarize epidemiologic data. Use information technology and computer software effectively for collection, management, analysis and presentation of public health data.</strong></p>
<p>I have been trained to use R, SAS and SPSS to do statistical analyses. I also learned how to use MySQL by myself. From course EPID 630, I learned client - server structure which is the common structure of health informatics constructions and managing skills of health informatics projects.</p>
<p>For data collection, I learned how to used RedCap system from my fieldwork and course EPID 622 data management.</p>
<p><strong>7. Describe assumptions, procedures, strengths and limitations of statistical methods that are used in public health research. Select statistical methods that are suitable for different purposes of analysis and different types of data. Apply statistical methods correctly in public health research</strong></p>
<p>We discussed theories, advantages, disadvantages, typical using circumstances and study processes of case control study, cohort study, random controlled trial in the courses ad CUNY SPH. And we also learned how to choose tests, measurements, models and recoding process based on the type of variables.</p>
<p><strong>8. Write scientific reports of statistical analyses correctly with tables and figures. Accurately describe computer outputs of those analyses and appropriately interpret the statistical results.</strong></p>
<p>I have been trained with writing assignments in different course at CUNY SPH. There are some examples in the <em>Academic Reports</em> part of this portfolio.</p>
<p><strong>9. Orally present statistical findings clearly and effectively</strong></p>
<p>I am able to present academic reports, statistical results to different audiences. Here are some of my presenting experiences:</p>

The burden has been increasing since 1990 but still does not have a slowing down trend2,3. Up to now, in the United States, the burdens of obesity have been increasing and reached about 20% to 30% in different states4. On the other hand, there are many risk factors for obesity. One major risk factor of obesity claims by previous studies is mental health status. People who have mental illnesses could have 2 to 3 times risk of having obesity5. We will discuss the relationship between obesity and mental status in this paper.</p>
<p>Controlling for confounders is a normal considering when we want to measure the relationship between to conditions, and so do this time. There are also confounders between obesity and mental status. Both obesity and mental status are related to many chronic diseases. Hypertension, Dyslipidemia, and Diabetes1. Hypothyroidism6-8, Cushing’s Syndrome9,10, and polycystic Ovary Syndrome11 could cause a weight change of their patients. Besides, some drugs like Antidepressants12, Antipsychotics13, Sulfonylureas14, Thiazolidinediones14, Insulin14, Antiepileptic drugs15, Corticosteroids14 and Beta-blockers14 which are used to cure mental diseases, diabetes, hypertension, epilepsy, cardiovascular diseases, and autoimmune diseases can also cause a weight change. In another direction, chronic conditions have also been proved as a risk factor of mental illnesses16,17. Therefore, to have an accurate estimation of the relationship between mental status and obesity, we need to adjust to chronic diseases as confounders.</p>
<p>However, there is a problem between these confounders. Chronic diseases are usually related to each other. Some typical examples are diabetes and hypertension18; diabetes and asthma19; hypertension and kidney failure20, etc. If covariates are not independent with each other, it will influence the accuracy of the coefficient parameter21. The classical process would choose to use stepwise strategy and remove co-linear items22 which could lose usage of collected data.</p>
<p>Propensity score23 is an approach that could help with the co-linearity covariates without eliminating them out of the data analysis24,25. The propensity score is the predicted probability for individuals in the dataset of being exposed by giving confounding values. One way to utilize the score is to adjust for the covariates. In observational studies, individuals are typically clustered into different exposure groups with different probabilities, where the confounding can occur. Therefore, by controlling for the propensity score, confounders can also be adjusted23.</p>
<p>In this study, regression models would be fitted to test on what extent that propensity score could enhance the relationship estimation between self-reported mental status and obesity. Based on previous studies, we expected that the adjusted relationship would be positive, which means people with poorer mental status could have more chances to get obese.</p>
<h4 id="Method"><a href="#Method" class="headerlink" title="Method"></a>Method</h4><p><strong>Data</strong></p>
<p>Dataset of NYC HANES 2014-2014 (New York City Health and Nutrition Examination Survey)26 was used in the analyses. The dataset includes participants from households who live in five boroughs, over 20 years old, and non-institutionalized. There were two layers in the sampling strategy of this dataset. In the first layer, NYC was geologically recognized as 6236 segments and 144 segments are randomly picked. In the selected segments, 0 to 2 household adults were randomly selected based on how many eligible adults are living in the houses within the 144 segments. The reason to select by houses is to minimize the household-to-household clustering. The total response rate was 36%. 1524 participants finished the survey.</p>
<p>Several variables in the NYC HANES dataset were used in this analysis:</p>
<p>‘Self-reported mental condition (MHQ_1)’ was chosen as the interested exposure. It is a 5-categories choice question. In some of our analysis, we transformed it into a binary variable by whether the self-reported mental status is ‘poor’ or not. ‘Body Mass Index (BMI)’ is a measurement that already generated in the dataset. The outcome variable in this analysis ‘whether obese’ was created based on this variable. If one participant’s BMI was over 30, he would be marked as ‘obese’. Five chronic diseases covariates were considered in the analysis: ‘whether having high blood pressure (BPQ_2), ‘whether having diabetes or sugar diabetes (DIQ_1)’, ‘whether having cancer or malignancy (MCQ_14)’, ‘whether having asthma (MCQ_1)’ and ‘whether having failing kidneys (MCQ_12)’. Besides, six mental health questions (MHQ_2 to MHQ_7) were used for validity tests. Age and Gender were used as common confounder and modifier. (Details of questions and items used in this analysis would be added to the appendix.)</p>
<p><strong>Cronbach alpha</strong></p>
<p>To check the validity of the outcome variables, self-reported mental health, Cronbach alphas are calculated. There are seven questions (MHQ1 - MHQ7) that asked all participants about their mental mood. The first question was picked as the outcome. Cronbach alpha is calculated based on the answers of the seven questions to see whether they have a good consistency. During data processing, we re-coded question MHQ-1 to let it have the same direction with the other six questions of representing mental status from better to worse rather than from worse to better.</p>
<p><strong>Weighting Sample</strong></p>
<p>Two parts of the survey results were covered in our analyses: computer interview and physical tests, which correspond to two weights in the dataset (CAPI_WT and EXAM_WT). The sample size of the computer interview is 1,527 and the sample size of the physical tests is 1500. In the regression analyses, participants with missing data are removed. Therefore, the weight of the physical tests, which have lower samples, was used to adjusting in the models.</p>
<p><strong>Univariate Analysis and Multivariate Analysis</strong></p>
<p>In the univariate analysis part, to comparing regression coefficients of the chronic diseases, we also added age and gender into the models:</p>
<p>(model 1)</p>
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
\text{Obese}_{i} = \beta_{1}*{Self - reported Mental Health}_{i} + \beta_{2}*\text{Age}_{i} + \beta_{3}*{Self - reported Mental Health}_{i}*\text{Gender} + \beta_{4}*\text{Gender} + \xi_{i}</script><p>(model 2)</p>

<p>This table shows the distribution of covariates that include in the analyses among participants with different obesity status. ‘Mental Status: Poor’, which is the binary-transformed variable from ‘Mental Status’ is the exposure variable in the following analyses.</p>
<p><strong>Questionnaire Validity</strong></p>
<p>We calculated the Cronbach alpha for seven mental questions that asked all participants (MHQ_1 to MHQ_7). The alpha of answers to the seven questions is over 0.8, which indicates that they have a high consistency. Any banning of the variables could cause a reduction of the alpha value.</p>

<p><strong>Classical Regression Analysis</strong></p>
<p>Table 3 shows the result of univariate analysis and multivariable regression. Parameter of diabetes and kidney failure have obvious changes between the univariate model and the multivariate model. Other covariates and exposure did not change a lot in the multivariate model. P-value of exposure increased.</p>
<p><strong>Regression with Propensity Score</strong></p>
<p>The propensity score, which means the probability of exposure estimated by confounders, is fitted for each individual with a logistic regression model. Table 3 compares how the regression coefficient of self-reported mental status change between classical regression and regression using the propensity score.</p>
<p>To have a better view of natural log odds distribution under 5 original different self-reported status, two regression models with ordinal exposure degree were fitted and shown in Table 4.</p>

<p><em>Note: The reference category of exposure was mental status equal to “poor”.</em></p>
<h4 id="Discussion"><a href="#Discussion" class="headerlink" title="Discussion"></a>Discussion</h4><p><strong>The validity of the exposure question.</strong></p>
<p>Since the exposure in this study is the self-reported mental status. The validity of this question needed to be checked. From the Cronbach’s alpha in Table 2, we can see that the total alpha of the questions was over 0.8, which means the consistency of these questions was high and they were not results that participants randomly made. Besides, by removing any of the questions, the total alpha would reduce, which means the answers to these questions were unique.</p>
<p><strong>Relationship between self-reported mental status and obesity.</strong></p>
<p>The result from regressions with original confounders and propensity scores in Table 3 are similar. The odds of being obese is lower among people whose self-reported mental health status is ‘poor’. Results in Table 4 indicate that this relationship is becoming stronger when the self-reported mental status is lower. In models using the propensity score, this relationship is confounded by age, older people have less chance of being obese, which is opposite to the initial hypothesis from the literature review. We can also reject the hypothesis that this relationship is not modified by gender on 0.05 critical criteria. By controlling for other covariates, the natural log odds of obese males are 1.75 higher than females. The model also showed the confounding effect of hypertension and asthma. People with these chronic diseases could have lesser odds of being obese.</p>
<p>However, the causal property is hard to extract from the results. Firstly, the NYC HANES is a cross-sectional survey that does not have temporal order in different variables. Secondly, the causal direction, in this case, is unclear. To illustrate the causal pathway, a cohort study would a better design.</p>
<p><strong>Effect of using propensity score approach in regression.</strong></p>
<p>The regression coefficient of exposure did not change a lot in models with propensity score. However, since the standard error of the parameter reduced a little bit, the p-value was also reduced. By comparing the regression parameter of chronic diseases from univariate analysis to multivariable analysis, we can notice that some chronic disease changed their regression coefficient and p-values like diabetes and kidney failure, this means these chronic diseases are actually related to each other. Besides, the regression coefficient and p-value of age as a confounder also changed in the model with propensity score, which could reduce biases from chronic diseases.</p>
<h4 id="Limitation"><a href="#Limitation" class="headerlink" title="Limitation"></a>Limitation</h4><p>The propensity score was not showing its power in this case obviously. By using the propensity score approach to control for confounders, it can also resolve two problems other than correlations between confounders: the unacceptably large number of covariates and unknown confounders. If we could have more records about chronic disease, the difference between classical multivariable analysis and regression with propensity score could be more obvious.</p>
<p>Besides, the number of exposed individuals was relatively low in this analysis. It could influence the power of the analyses which needs to be concerned if the result were not statistically significant. And it may also reduce the precision of our results.</p>
<h4 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h4><p>Among people who live in New York city and older than 20 years old and have ‘poor’ self-reported mental status is negatively related to obesity. By controlling for age and chronic diseases, the odds of being obese for people whose self-reported mental status is ‘poor’ is 0.35 (95%CI: 0.13, 0.93) times than other people.</p>
<p>The propensity score approach in this analysis did not improve the model obviously.</p>

<h4 id="Introduction-1"><a href="#Introduction-1" class="headerlink" title="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h4><p>In 1996, the Australian government exempted a new gun law that banned semiautomatic rifles and pump-action shotguns and started to buyback firearms. Chapman, et al, did an analysis to reveal whether the law change had brought changes in death rates for different reasons related to gunshot [1]. This document is the assignment of BIOS 621 and I will repeat one outcome (total non-firearm death rate) in Chapman, et al’s article with same statistical methods and compare the usage of log negative binomial regression and log Poisson regression in this situation.</p>
<h4 id="Method-1"><a href="#Method-1" class="headerlink" title="Method"></a>Method</h4><h5 id="Data-setting"><a href="#Data-setting" class="headerlink" title="Data setting"></a>Data setting</h5><h6 id="Rate-calculation"><a href="#Rate-calculation" class="headerlink" title="Rate calculation"></a>Rate calculation</h6><p>Since the total death is gradually growing, comparing the absolute death number change in two law backgrounds could be affected. Therefore, as the same thing the author did, a death rate is calculated by the total death divide by the total person-year at risk for some linear regression calculation in this assignment.</p>
<h5 id="Analysis-processes"><a href="#Analysis-processes" class="headerlink" title="Analysis processes"></a>Analysis processes</h5><p>At the first step, log (mean) and log (standard deviation) of the outcome measure (total non-firearm death) and their stratified results are calculated to see whether the outcome could be recognized as a Poisson distribution. If the outcome is in Poisson distribution, the log(mean) and log (standard deviation) should be similar.</p>
<p>The second step is to calculate the mean and 95% confidence interval of the total non-firearm death rate in two law backgrounds (before 1997 and after 1997). Three solutions are attempt to get the result. The first one is to treat the means of non-firearm death rate before and after the law change are in two sample distributions (t distribution). Therefore, the standard error of the means could be calculated by standard deviation divided by square root of n into two periods of time, where n means that number of means in two periods of time. The degree of freedom is equal to n – 1. The formula is shown as (1).</p>

<p>From the result, we can know that in the year of 1979 to 1996 before the law change, the average trend of total non-firearm death rate is 1.002 (rate ratio) from model (4), while in the year of 1997 to 2013 after the law change, the trend of total non-firearm death rate is 0.986 (rate ratio). The change of this difference in log of the rate ratio is -0.0348 (the change of slope of two period log(rate ratio)) from model 6 and this difference is statistically significant.</p>

Actually, they are the same. Law = 0 equals to year  &lt; 1997, and Law = 1 equals to year  &gt;= 1997. If we add the β of Year * Law in model (6) with the β of Year in model (6), we could get the same value of Year’s β in model (5). If we do not add anything to the β of Year in model (6), it equals with the β of Year in model (4). In fact, the β of Year * Law in model (6) describes the differences between the Years’ beta of model (4) and model (5), and we can additionally notice the standard error and p-value of these difference in model (6). That’s why I don’t have to try another separated model for Poisson regression.</p>
<h5 id="Model-comparison"><a href="#Model-comparison" class="headerlink" title="Model comparison"></a>Model comparison</h5><p>From AIC, we can notice that the log negative binomial model fits better than log Poisson regression.</p>
<p>The Log Likelihood of Negative Binomial model is higher than log Poisson, which also means the model (7) fits better.</p>
<p>From the estimating lines (Fig 2.) the two models provided quite same estimating curve, the only difference I noticed is that the end of the blue line (total non-firearm death rate before law change) (in the green circle) in the log Poisson regression is a little bit higher than the log negative binomial regression.</p>
<p>The diagnostic plots of the two models (Fig 3.) are almost the same, the only difference I noticed is in the Q-Q plots. It seems that the error term in log negative binomial regression is better normally distributed than the log Poisson regression.</p>
<h5 id="Limitation-1"><a href="#Limitation-1" class="headerlink" title="Limitation"></a>Limitation</h5><p>It’s understandable that the rate after the law change is still higher because the rate is just starting to decreasing after the low change by the result of the regressions.</p>
<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ry2an/my_picture_garage/master/bios623as2/fig6.png" alt="fig6"></p>
<p><strong>Fig 6. Histogram of total non-firearm death rate in two interested period</strong></p>
<p>However, what we should expect from the law change is that the death rate of firearm could be lower. So, what about the non-firearm deaths? Shall it increase because fewer people will be killed by gunshot? Or shall it be stable because people could still be alive if they avoid the gunshot? Or shall it decrease because people are healthier and healthier? We need a comparison. If we have a global or other comparable total non-firearm death rate, we could know whether the law has actually changed something. If naturally the total non-firearm death rate is decreased after 1996 if some grate medical product has been made, the curve could be same without the law change. After comparing with a counterfactual rate, we could take a deeper insight in to the reason for total non-firearm deaths started to decrease after the law change.</p>
<p>If we do not know the background of the law change, the curve of death rate could be seemed very normal, just a little peak in 1996. Actually, the most obvious change in the raw curve is around 1998 and after 2005. But we do not know whether something important happened at that time. Even there is a cause of raw curve changing happed in the year 1996, we could not distinguish whether it was the law upgrade or other potential mediators and confounders.</p>
<p>The last thing I want to discuss is that the confidence intervals in the model (7) (Log Poisson Regression) is narrower than the model (6) (Log Negative Binomial Regression). However, both the AIC and log-likelihood show that the log negative binomial regression is better. That is because although log Poisson regression is more precise in this case because of its strict distribution assumption, it lost accuracy compare to the negative binomial regression.</p>
<h4 id="Conclusion-1"><a href="#Conclusion-1" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h4><p>This assignment has totally repeated the result of Chapman, et al in the analysis of total non-firearm death rate that the trend of the rate has statistical significantly changed after the year of 1996. From 1979 - 1996, the mean rate of total non-firearm death rate was 10.61 (95%CI, 10.09 - 11.16) per 100,000 person-year (annual trend 1.021, 95%CI: 1.016 - 1.026), whereas from 1997 - 2013, the mean rate of total non-firearm deaths rate was 11.79 (95%CI: 11.21, 12.41) per 100,000 person-year (annual trend 0.986, 95%CI: 0.981, 0.992).</p>
<p>Besides, this assignment compared Log Negative Binomial Regression’s and Log Poisson regression’s performance under this circumstance. The result shows that Log Negative Binomial Regression is better than Log Poisson regression in this case.</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ry2an/my_picture_garage/master/bios623as3/table2.png" alt="table2"></p>
<p>The results of univariate analysis show that the hazard ratio of ‘week 8’ group compared by ‘week 1’ group and ‘week 4’ group are both not statistically significant by 1 (both parameters not statistically significant by 0). However, parameter of CD4, Albumin conditions and BMI are statistically significant than 0 at 0.05 critical criteria.</p>
<p>In the multivariable analysis, the conditions of the p-values for covariates are roughly the same with the univariate analysis. Both parameter of ‘week 1’ and ‘week 4’ treatments are not statistically significant by 0. The parameter of CD4, Albumin and conditions are statistically significant than 0 at 0.05 critical criteria. The only difference happened in the parameter ‘BMI’. It is significant at 0.1 critical criteria but not significant at 0.05 critical criteria.</p>

<p>All of the residuals lying close to ‘0’. For Schenfeld residuals, we can the confidence intervals are always contain 0 for each covariates. This indicates that the multivariable model has a good fit so that the error term could stay in the distribution assumed by the model.</p>
<h4 id="Discussion-2"><a href="#Discussion-2" class="headerlink" title="Discussion"></a>Discussion</h4><p>There are several discrepancy between my results with the original paper. In the univariate analysis multivariable analysis, the regression coefficient of ‘CD4’ and ‘Albumin’ are not same with the paper. Coefficient of ‘Week 1’ are not same in the multivariable analysis. I think the reason is because of the data from the supplement of the paper. Although I analyzed with people who lost follow up before the treatment by considering the intention to treat approach, which was the same as the authors did in their paper, we can see that there are discrepancy between the number of people who died or quit before the treatment. In the paper, the number of three groups (‘week1’, ‘week4’ and ‘week8’) who received the treatment is 149, 147 and 135, while from the data they are 150, 146, and 137. This could lead the survival probability of three treatments different with the original paper at least when first event happens. Besides, In this assignment, I didn’t include ‘Hepatotoxicity requiring interruption of TB therapy’ as a covariate in the model, which could also lead different results.</p>

<p>Although the parameters of different treatments are not significant in the model, we can still see a trend among three treatments: Hazard Ratio: week 1 : week 8 = 1.7; week 4 : week 8 = 1.2; week 8 : week 8 = 1. It is obvious that by controlling with other covariates, the later the patient receive the treatments, the higher of the survival probability could be. But it’s just not statistically significant.</p>
<p>In my opinion, there could be two solutions to figure out whether there is a trend between treatment time point and survival probability. The first one is to increase the sample size. I will use the parameter of ‘week 1’ in the multivariable analysis as an example. The standard error of this parameter is 0.314, which means only when the regression coefficient is larger than about 0.314 * 1.96 = 0.615 (negatively calculate is the same mechanism), it could be statistically significant at 0.05 critical criteria. That means the hazard ratio compare ‘week 8’ with ‘week 1’ should be larger than exp(0.615) = 1.85. However, as far as I am concerned, 1.5, or 1.2 are still meaningful results for the context. It’s just the study do not have enough power to prove it is statistically significant. In another words, if the standard error of ‘week 1’ could reduced to about 0.511 / 1.96 = 0.261, the result could be statistically significant at 0.05 critical criteria. We know that in the ‘week 1’ group, there are 163 participants, which means the variance of the regression coefficient in target population could be estimated as 0.314 * (163)^0.5 = 4.01. If we want the standard error (the variance of the sample mean of the regression coefficient from target population) to be less than 0.261, the sample size of the treatment group should be more than (4.01 / 0.261)^2 = 236. It is not a huge number, if the study could also increase the number of participants in ‘week 8’, the number could be lesser.</p>
<p>Another solution is to find another approach by assuming the outcome variable do have an order, with stronger assumption, the parameters could be farther to null hypothesis.</p>
<h4 id="Conclusion-2"><a href="#Conclusion-2" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion:"></a>Conclusion:</h4><p>From current results, we cannot deny the hypothesis that treatments in three different times could lead same survival curve, which means the hazard ratio of ‘week 1’ and ‘week 4’ compare to ‘week 8’ are same with 1. However, from the result, we could notice that other covariates like baseline CD4, Albumin and BMI status could be more related to different cumulative survival probability by time in the target population.</p>

<h4 id="Introduction-3"><a href="#Introduction-3" class="headerlink" title="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h4><p>Video games, as an emerging merchandise, are usually selling their copies through online stores and physical storage disks. Before a game marked by a price and selling on markets, it should be developed by a developer group and be published by a publisher company. The game prices set by publisher could contain the cost of making the games and advertising fees, which is related to the quality of the games. Steam is the most famous video game digital distribution service developed by Valve Corporation. Most game publishers on the world publish soft copies of games on Steam game store. In the online store, developer, publisher, price, and customers’ reviews are recorded and updated on each game’s web-page.</p>
<p>Overall rating is a count number of all negative reviews (comments) and positive reviews (comments), which in other words is total review numbers (Fig 1). This value should be positively related to sells volume, because on Steam, only players who bought the game can give comments on the web page (one comment per player). The actual selling volume are hidden from the published data I acquired, so that I chose this as dependent variable, which could be considered as a proxy of overall selling volume. In cross-sectional analyses, it is hard to directly analyze the relationship between the game prices with overall ratings. Because the games are not independent with each other, famous publishers and developers could always have some fans love whatever game they made, while small companies may not sell their games well even the quality of the games they made aren’t that worse. Besides, the volume between different publisher are not the same, larger publisher could have more game published in the online stores, which may bias the relationship between price and the game ratings.</p>

<p><strong>Fig 1. Different Reviews (Negative and Positive) of a Game Called “Foxhole” on Steam Game Store</strong></p>
<p>In this analysis, I will use different longitudinal models (linear mixed effect models, fixed effect models and generalized estimating equation) to analyze the relationship between game prices and overall ratings in steam online stores among different game publishers. From the results of this analysis, game publishers could see whether the game prices settings is positively or negatively related with overall ratings. And so that they could have a deeper understanding of requirement from player on the view of games prices when they want to publish new games in future.</p>

The data collected all available games in U.S. steam online game store in May, 2019. The data is gathered through <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Steam_Spy&amp;oldid=929122689">SteamSpy</a>, a website uses an application programming interface (API) to the Steam software distribution service owned by Valve Corporation to estimate the number of sales of software titles offered on the service created by Sergey Galyonkin [2].</p>
<p>There are several fields in the dataset I acquired and I will use in this analysis: Publisher ID; Game ID; English (whether the game support English Language), Release Date; Overall Ratings and Price of each game.</p>
<p>Publisher enrolling</p>
<p>To use longitudinal models, multiple published records are needed for each publisher. Besides, small publisher companies who only published two or three games may not show a mature pattern between game price and overall ratings. Therefore, by creating a histogram and looking the distribution of counts of published game, I decided to use publishers who published more than eight games in the analysis.(Fig 2)</p>
<p>I also excluded free game records in the dataset, although, I reviewed the distribution of published game price (Fig 3) and it dose not show obvious ceiling effect or zero-inflated distribution. It is because that mostly, the commercial mode of free games are not same with the paid games. They usually sell extra components in the game which did not mention in the data. And so that it may bias the relationship between game prices and overall ratings. Please notice that after removed free games, there could be some publishers have game counts lower than eight.</p>
<p>I also added 0.1 to overall ratings for all games in case that some games’ overall rating is 0, which may not able to do the log transformation. (I would chose to use the log transformation because of the results of descriptive statistics (Fig 4).)</p>

Rather than focusing the estimated parameter of ‘price’ in the FEM models, I would pay more attention of the distributions of fixed terms in the models. Distribution of fixed intercepts and slopes are plotted to see whether they are normally distributed. If they are normally distributed, we could use a stronger assumption and use LME the models to fit the data.</p>
<p><em>Intercept:</em></p>

<p>For the “fixed slopes”, I mean the actually slope of price fitted by this fixed effect model for each publisher.</p>
<p>$\textrm{Fixed Slope} = \beta_1+ \beta_2 * \alpha_i$</p>
<p>I wanted to use the offset() function in the regression of avoid the existence of β2. However, the program did not run well on this. So I still kept the β2. Fortunately, in this case, the existence of β2 does not affect the calculation of ‘fixed slopes’.</p>
<h4 id="Generalized-Estimating-Equation-GEE"><a href="#Generalized-Estimating-Equation-GEE" class="headerlink" title="Generalized Estimating Equation (GEE)"></a>Generalized Estimating Equation (GEE)</h4><p>In GEE model, I will use the original overall ratings data because GEE model could handle discreet data. Since the GEE model need same number of records for each publisher. To have a better understanding of correlation matrix, again, I chose the number of game counts in the dataset by the game count distribution (Fig 13). Finally, a subset of GEE model is created by choosing publishers published equal or more than 5 games. And 5 games are randomly chosen into the subset. There are 323 publishers and 1615 games are in the subset.</p>
<p>Before starting to fit the GEE model. Correlation Matrix of 5 games among publishers are calculated and plotted to determine what correlation matrix to use in the GEE model. Unfortunately, due to technical reason, although I tested the correlation matrix and checked the mean and standard deviation of overall ratings are same or not, I still chose to use Poisson distribution and “exchange” correlation matrix.</p>
<p>$log(\lambda_{ij})= \beta_0 + \beta_1*(\textrm{Price}_{ij})$, </p>
<p>$\textrm{Overall ratings}_{ij} \in Poisson(\lambda_{ij})$, </p>

<p><strong><center>Fig 2. Game Counts Distribution</center></strong></p>
<p>In order to find a proper criteria to remove publishers only publisher one game or published too less game to bias the pattern of prices and overall ratings. From the plot, we can notice that there is a peak around log(counts) = 2, so that I decided to enroll publishers who have published more than exp(2) ≈ 8.</p>

<p><strong><center>Fig 3. Game Price Distribution</center></strong></p>
<p><em>Note: I added 0.1 in the free game prices to generate this plot, otherwise the log price for free games are negative infinity.</em></p>
<p>From the plot, we can see the distribution of game price is that most game log prices are between 1 and 3. And also there is another peak of game frequency for free games and game prices less than 1 dollar.</p>
<p>The publisher include criteria are created based on the results above. In raw data, their are 14137 game publisher and 27075 published games. Among them, 324 publishers and their 7299 games are selected to be analysis.</p>
<p>In the subset for analysis, distribution of independent variable and dependent variable are plotted as following:</p>

<p><strong><center>Fig 4. Basic Description of Subset Data</center></strong></p>
<p>From the plot, we can see that price and mean price do not have an obvious distribution. The original overall ratings have some extremely high value cases, and skewed to the right. The log of overall rating is kind of a unimodal distribution. Therefore, in the longitudinal models, except GEE models (for discrete outcome), I would use the log of overall ratings as the dependent variable.</p>

<p><strong><center>Fig 5. Line plot by comparing game prices and overall ratings for each publisher</center></strong></p>
<p>From this plot, we can see that there is a weak correlation between log of overall ratings and price. Especially, over 20 dollars, the smoothed line is almost straight. The correlation for original overall ratings is not obvious.</p>

<p>From the results, we can see that both of the fixed intercepts and slopes are quite normally distributed.</p>
<p>Before using GEE model, I generated a subset which contain all the 323 publishers who have more than 5 non-free games in the data and randomly picked 5 games for each publisher. Then randomly picked 100 publishers to fit the GEE model. The reason of why I chose 5 is because the following distribution of free game counts:</p>

<p><strong><center>Fig 13. Non-Free Game Counts of Every Publisher</center></strong></p>
<p>To choose what kind of correlated matrix to use in the GEE model, I plotted the correlation of games in five prices. When calculated in the correlation matrix, for each publisher, there could be duplicate prices for publishers. I randomly gave order for same prices.</p>

What the models tell the game publishers?"></a>What are overall ratings indicating? What the models tell the game publishers?</h5><p>Overall ratings may not be the most import measurement for game publishers, but actually it is the most important variable in the dataset I acquired. Firstly, as mentioned in introduction, the number of overall ratings is positively related to the selling volume. On the other hand, if there are lots of comments, publishers could get many reviews of the game, which could also help publishers and developers editing the game. Therefore, for each game, publishers do expect more comments / higher overall rating. The results of this analysis could help publishers expecting the overall ratings value (the number of total comments) by the setting of game price.</p>
<p>On average, for each publisher, the higher price one game published with, the more comments (higher overall ratings) is expected to acquire. However, this not means that a game with infinity price would have infinity overall rating. From LME models of testing non-linearity (LME-3), and with other covariates (LME4, LME-5) should that there are other factors effecting the relationship between game price and overall ratings. Besides, publishers cannot based on the results to set the game prices unreasonable high. The results can only tell us games with higher price could have higher overall ratings. Actually speaking, to receive higher overall ratings, the publishers should publish games that worth that higher prices.</p>
<h5 id="Which-model-is-the-best-to-describe-the-relationship-between-game-price-and-selling-volume"><a href="#Which-model-is-the-best-to-describe-the-relationship-between-game-price-and-selling-volume" class="headerlink" title="Which model is the best to describe the relationship between game price and selling volume?"></a>Which model is the best to describe the relationship between game price and selling volume?</h5><p>Since there will be many models discussed in this part, I will give my answer at first. In my opinion, the linear effect model with random intercept and random slope describes the relationship in a best way. Firstly, compare with the cross sectional model, longitudinal models could control for the difference between each publisher, sot hat it could reduce the confounding effect between game prices and overall ratings. The regression coefficient of price in cross-sectional model is higher than the longitudinal models, which means that the proportion of publishers who have more overall ratings is higher in the dataset.</p>
<p>Secondly, for generalized estimating equation, I put too many adjustments in that model. Because GEE model require each publisher have same amount of published games, I removed the publishers who have less than five games in the analyzing dataset and randomly chose five games for publishers who have more than five games. Besides, I should use the “unstructured” correlation model to fit the data. However, it would cost too much times to finish it. And at last, I still use “exchangeable” correlation matrix in the model. And the original count data isn’t a good dependent variable in this case.</p>
<p>Thirdly, in the fixed effect models, we can see that the fixed intercepts and slopes are quite normally distributed (Fig 9, Fig 10), which means we can make a stronger hypothesis that this intercepts and slopes are normally distributed.</p>
<p>Also from AIC and the Log likelihoods, the LME model with random intercept and random slope was still the best one among models without other covariates.</p>
<h5 id="Whether-we-should-controlling-released-time-in-the-model"><a href="#Whether-we-should-controlling-released-time-in-the-model" class="headerlink" title="Whether we should controlling released time in the model?"></a>Whether we should controlling released time in the model?</h5><p>At first, I do not want to adjust for released date because it is not associated with game price. The common prices setting of video games has not been changed for quite long time. The game with higher quality and made by large game companies (AAA games) would have a price of 59.99 dollars. There are also some lower settings like 49.99 dollars, 29.99 dollars or 23.99 dollars. Actually the setting of game prices is not that clear lower than 49.99 dollars. Although, on the other hand, release time is strongly related to the number of overall ratings, I still did not think released time could be a confounder. However, I noticed that some games would permanently reduced prices after resealed for a long time like about 1 year or 2 years. There are also some games permanently enhanced their prices because the developers made a great update and enhanced the overall game quality. Therefore, I finally included the released time in the analyses. The result shows that, after controlled by released time, the game price is also positively related to the overall ratings.</p>
<h5 id="Limitations-of-the-analysis"><a href="#Limitations-of-the-analysis" class="headerlink" title="Limitations of the analysis"></a>Limitations of the analysis</h5><p>In the analysis, there are three spots that I manually decide to remove some records from the dataset. The first one is that I only include publishers who published more than eight games in the analysis. The main reason of doing this is to fit the requirement of longitudinal data that each individual should have several records. Although I did find some evidence from the distribution of published game counts to say patterns from publishers who published more than eight games should be more stable and mature than from new game publishers, it is still lack of scientific supports. The second spot was in the GEE model, because I need reduce the number of records and for each individual publishers, I need same game records. Therefore, I randomly picked 5 games from each publishers.</p>
<p>In longitudinal analysis, both of these problem could have another solution: for example, if there is a publisher only published 2 games and have different game prices and overall ratings, I could estimate overall ratings at other game prices for this publisher by basic algebra. However, there is another problem in this solution: I do not know what price I should estimated by. No one knows if there is another game published by the publisher, what game price would it be set. But all in all, there is data from the original dataset did not include in the model. Therefore, I should set the target population to be game publishers who published more than eight games.</p>
<p>The third spot is that I did not involve free games in the analysis. In reason is that most free games have paid services in the game and it is hard to count it’s price because it’s different by player. However, there could also have few games that actually because of the poor game quality to be set as free games. But I did not include them in the model. Therefore, the result</p>
<p>Another limitation is about the correlation of overall ratings. By introducing longitudinal analysis and setting publishers as individual, the correlation of overall ratings has been counted and fitted in the models. However, Not only there are publishers publish games from different developers, but also there is a few amount of developers who publish their games in different publishers. This means There still could be correlations of overall ratings among different publishers because they published different games from same developers.</p>
<p>There are lots of other variables effect the overall ratings like the types of games, whether the game is published on other platforms and how the publisher advertising the game. Further analysis could concern more covariates to make the mechanism of how prices effects overall ratings clearer.</p>
<h4 id="Conclusion-3"><a href="#Conclusion-3" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h4><p>This analysis shows that on average, game price is positively related to the overall ratings. For one dollar increased on the game price for one publisher among publishers who published more than eight games, there is about 0.06 promotion in log overall rating of the game. This analysis also proved that this positively relationship is not linear. And games’ overall rating could also be effect by other variables like whether the game have English version or released date.</p>

    1、请确保node版本大于6.2<br/>
    2、在博客根目录（注意不是archer根目录）执行以下命令：<br/>
    <span style="color: #f75357; font-size: 1rem; line-height: 2rem;">npm i hexo-generator-json-content --save</span><br/>
    3、在根目录_config.yml里添加配置：
